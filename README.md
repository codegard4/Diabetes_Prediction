Predicting Diabetes using 3 separate datasets of various risk factors

Diabetes costs an estimated $327 Billion per year in the United States alone (CDC). 
It is a disease that is on the rise, now affecting more than 37 million Americans (CDC). 
This paper will explore 3 separate data sets and build 3 unique models based on those data sets. 
Models will be compared to each other based on accuracy using success rate and other model features such as number 
of model variables and size of respective data sets.
